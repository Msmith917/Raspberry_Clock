# Raspberry_Clock
> Private repository dedicated to my raspberry pi clock project. 
> This project will be to create a clock with built in functions for my room

### Functions (should include but not limited to):
  ##### - Reading indoor and outdoor temperature and humidity
  ##### - Give update on current weather
  ##### - Tell the current time
  ##### - Ability to talk to me, i.e. (JASPER: tell me time, remind me to do things)
  ##### - Do I need a jacket? 

*I will step by step by step work to incorporate each of these functions to the Raspberry Pi
even using the Arduino as well. Start with a simple program that runs and on an infinite
loop and will not fail.*

## Look in the Wiki for more information on the following:
- Read Indoor Temperature
- Weather Report
- The Clock 
- Versions

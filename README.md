# Raspberry_Home
> Private repository dedicated to my raspberry pi smart home project. 
> This project will be to create a smart home for my room

### Functions (should include but not limited to):
  ##### - Reading/Adjusting temperature
  ##### - Motion sensor lights for when I walk in and out of a room
  ##### - Joke of the day button
  ##### - Record and send message when door is open during the day while I would be at school
  ##### - Smart Irrigation system, water plants and feed fish?

*I will step by step by step work to incorporate each of these functions to the Raspberry Pi
even using the Arduino as well. Start with a simple program that runs and on an infinite
loop and will not fail.*
